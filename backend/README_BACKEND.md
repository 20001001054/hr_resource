# HR Resource Query Chatbot

## Overview
The **HR Resource Query Chatbot** is an intelligent assistant that helps HR teams quickly find suitable employees from an internal resource pool.  
It uses **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** with semantic search (FAISS + Sentence Transformers) to match queries against employee profiles and returns the most relevant candidates in a conversational format.  

Example:  
> Query: *"Suggest people for a React Native project"*  
> Response:  
Based on your query, here are some recommended employees:

David Kim (3 years exp) Skills: React Native, JavaScript, Node.js Projects: Mobile Banking App Availability: busy

Isabella Garcia (4 years exp) Skills: React Native, Flutter, Mobile Apps Projects: Food Delivery App Availability: available

Olivia Brown (3 years exp) Skills: React, Vue.js, UI/UX Projects: Healthcare Appointment App Availability: available

## Features
- üîç **Semantic Search** ‚Äì Finds employees based on natural language queries.  
- üìÇ **Structured Employee Profiles** ‚Äì Includes skills, experience, projects, and availability.  
- ü§ñ **RAG Pipeline** ‚Äì Retrieval + Augmentation + Template-based Generation.  
- ‚ö° **FAISS Index** ‚Äì Fast and scalable vector search for embeddings.  
- üåê **API Layer** ‚Äì Simple REST endpoints for chat and employee search.  
- üí¨ **Chat UI (Frontend)** ‚Äì Interactive interface to query employees.

## Architecture
**System Components:**  
1. **Frontend** ‚Äì Chatbox UI (React/Streamlit/HTML).  
2. **Backend (FastAPI)** ‚Äì  
   - `/chat` ‚Üí Conversational endpoint.  
   - `/employees/search` ‚Üí Returns raw employee matches.  
3. **Utils Layer** ‚Äì Handles embedding, indexing, and search logic.  
4. **Model** ‚Äì `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` for embeddings.  
5. **Database** ‚Äì JSON file storing employee profiles.  

**Flow:**  
User Query ‚Üí Embedding ‚Üí FAISS Vector Search ‚Üí Retrieve Top Matches ‚Üí Augment with Profile Data ‚Üí Generate Chat Response.

## AI Development Process

- **AI Tools Used**: ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot.
- **Usage Phases**:
  - *Code Generation*: Used ChatGPT to scaffold backend FastAPI routes and RAG flow.
  - *Debugging*: Copilot assisted in catching syntax errors and improving function suggestions.
  - *Architecture*: ChatGPT helped decide the use of FAISS + Sentence Transformers.
- **AI-Assisted Code**: Approximately 60‚Äì70% of the code was AI-generated with manual refinements.
- **Notable Contributions**:
  - ChatGPT generated the RAG logic, helping us merge search results with employee profiles dynamically.
  - Optimized embedding and search functions were partially generated by AI and manually tuned.
- **Challenges**:
  - AI struggled with setting up the Streamlit UI layout properly; layout refinements were hand-coded.
  - Handling edge cases in FAISS search required manual testing and intervention.


## Technical Decisions

- **OpenAI vs Open-Source Models**:
  - Chose `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` for local, cost-effective embedding instead of OpenAI due to cost and privacy concerns.
- **Local LLM (Ollama) vs Cloud API**:
  - Focused on local embedding models for privacy and offline capabilities. Did not use full LLMs (e.g., Ollama or OpenAI ChatGPT API) due to compute constraints.
- **Performance vs Cost vs Privacy**:
  - FAISS was selected for fast vector search with low resource usage.
  - Data is processed locally‚Äîno employee data is sent to external APIs to preserve confidentiality.

## Future Improvements

- Add authentication and role-based access for HR teams.
- Replace Streamlit with a more interactive React frontend.
- Integrate a full LLM (via OpenAI API or Ollama) for more human-like conversation.
- Connect to a real-time HR database (e.g., PostgreSQL) instead of static JSON.
- Include feedback loop to refine search based on HR feedback.
